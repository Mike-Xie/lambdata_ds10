DF UTILS - completed

confusion matrix takes in y_pred and y_true from running a model and returns a dataframe object formatted like a crosstab

plot confusion matrix takes that dataframe object and plots it in color with a heatmap

train val test split is a wrapper that calls on sk learn's train_test_split twice to split thrice

DF UTILS - to be implemented

add list as column takes a list and a dataframe and appends the list to the dataframe as a column

add list as row takes a list and a dataframe and appends the list to the dataframe as a row

it probably makes sense to just make a column or list argument and turn those into one function

DF UTILS TEST - test suite
